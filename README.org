#+Title: Technonomicon ReadMe


* This repository is a work in progress
This is the final iteration of my person system configuration repository. It currently only holds the configuration for =Voyager=, my travel laptop. Eventually this flake will be moved into its own sub directory, and used as a template for other systems.

* This configuration use Emacs Org Tangle
I am attempting to combine literate programming. Via Org Tangle, with a modular configuration style to make it easier to remember the reasoning behind configuration choices. Generally each Directory level or file should equate to an Org Heading in a similar relative position.

** Flake.org
These file are rarely changed, and are generic across system configurations.

** System.org
These files are generally specific to each system, and are frequently changed based on daily needs.

* TODO's
** TODO Finalize =README.org=
** TODO Add Home-Manager-Static overlay
** TODO Get system speakers working
** TODO Configure EXWM to use Home-Manager Overlay
** TODO Sort and update firefox chrome settings
